# Storyteller

This is a simple web application that allows users to collaboratively write user
stories for a software project. If Pivotal Tracker is for _planning_ backlog
items, Storyteller is for _writing_ them.

## Proposed feature set

* Write user stories together with others.
* Discuss user stories using comments.
* Track changes in user stories.
* Keep track of simple requirements before a user story is "done".
* Organize user stories in epics.
* Work on multiple projects, with their own epics and stories.
* Export user stories to external services or files.
* Share design comps or wireframes along with user stories.

## Benefits

Writing user stories in Storyteller will be a better experience than writing in
textareas or tex documents because of syntax highlighting in the editor,
auto-completion of previously used steps, change tracking and automatic export
to related tools.

## Contribution

See the open pull requests. There's a bunch of them with pending Cucumber
features.
